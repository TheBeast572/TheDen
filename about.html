					<h1>How i got into Web Developement</h1>
					<p>I got into Web Development when i used to mess around with Developer Tools.  I changed my grades in school to "Fool" teachers (Especially the ones don't know much about tech) and after that day, I started to look at the base structure of HTML and how it was used to make websites. I copied some smaller websites and changed names of things and colors to make it my own until i finally just googled "How to make a website in HTML" and began my own projects. Once i made something i just got hooked and started to create more and learned more in the process.</p>
