		<h1>Welcome To Flappy Bird (Made By Eduardo Talavera)</h1>
		<p>No this is not a full replica of the game at all but this is the fundementals of Flappy Bird!
		Press Space to "Fly" and avoid the oncomming "Pipes" (The white solid blocks.) If you get hit
		I havn't made it so the game would stop but the Pipe color turns RED. This isn't ment to be
		at all a finished game but a way to push my javascript into a new level.</p>
